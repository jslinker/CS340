Error Report:

*HypeerWebDatabase
	-Database locks sometimes during testing. Added close statements to all the unclosed statements in HyPeerWebDatabase and that seemed to help, 
		might be computer dependent 
	-Height is not being stored in the database even though there is a column for it, reconstructs incorrect node as a result
	
*NodeCore	
	-Calling constructSimplifiedWebDomain on Null_Node generates null pointer
	-Calling setWebId on Null_Node generates null pointer
	-Calling equals using null pointer generates null pointer exception, should return false
	-Newly constructed NodeCore does not have itself as its fold.  Post condition on constructor from spec => (fold = this)
	-Adding down pointer to node and then calling constructSimplifiedNodeDomain and getting downpointers returns empty set. 
	
*NodeCore/Connection
	-Got into infinite loop several times when trying to find a node on these two lines, might just be me not calling code correctly
		at dbPhase.hypeerweb.Connection.getNode(Connection.java:204)
		at dbPhase.hypeerweb.NodeCore.getNode(NodeCore.java:341)
		****UPDATE****
		This problem happened when attempting to add nodes to the HyPeerWeb that already had some existing connections
	
*HyPeerWeb
	-HypeerWeb.reload does not restore full HyPeerWeb.
		added 15 nodes (15 = size)
		assertEquals(size,web.size());
		
		web.saveToDatabase();

		web.clear();
		assertEquals(0,web.size());
		
		web.reload();
		assertEquals(size,web.size());    <======== Fails on this line.  web.size() returns 1
		
	-Not really a bug, but saveToDatabase doesn't allow for custom database name whereas reload does.
	
	-getAllNodes doesn't return list of correct size
		web.addToHyPeerWeb(new NodeCore(0), NodeCore.getNullNode());
		web.addToHyPeerWeb(new NodeCore(1), NodeCore.getNullNode());
		web.addToHyPeerWeb(new NodeCore(2), NodeCore.getNullNode());
		
		web.saveToDatabase();
		
		assertEquals(3, web.getHyPeerWebDatabase().getSingleton().getAllNodes().size());  <==== .size() returns 1
