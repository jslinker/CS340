<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Fold</B>:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Node x has a fold y if and only if the
web id w<SUB>y</SUB> of y is the binary complement of the web id w<SUB>x</SUB>
of x. The fold relationship is symmetric, thus if x R y then y R x.
Note that the fold relationship is only reflexive if and only if
there is one node in the HyPeerWeb, then node zero is the fold of
node zero.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Surrogate Fold and Inverse Surrogate
Fold</B>:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Node x has a surrogate fold z if and
only if node y with web id w<SUB>y</SUB>, from the above example, is
not yet added to the HyPeerWeb. The relationship between x and z is
that w<SUB>x</SUB> and w<SUB>z</SUB> differ in every bit but the most
significant bit and w<SUB>z</SUB> and w<SUB>y</SUB> differ only in
the most significant bit. Furthermore, if z is a surrogate fold to x
then x is an inverse surrogate fold to z.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>A note on folds</B>:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any given node can have a fold, a fold
and an inverse surrogate fold, or a surrogate fold.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Neighbors</B>:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Node u and node v are neighbors iff
their web ids w<SUB>u</SUB> and w<SUB>v</SUB> differ by a single bit.
If u is a neighbor of v then v is a neighbor of u, therefore the
neighbor property is symmetric.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Surrogate Neighbors and Inverse
Surrogate Neighbors</B>:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Node b is a surrogate neighbor to c iff
the neighbor d does not yet exist in the HyPeerWeb. The web id of d,
w<SUB>d</SUB>, differs by a single bit from w<SUB>c</SUB>, the web id
of c. The web id w<SUB>b</SUB> differs from w<SUB><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">d</SPAN></SUB>
only in the most significant bit. If b is a surrogate neighbor to c,
then c is an inverse surrogate neighbor to b.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Parent and Child</B>:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A node c has a parent p when w<SUB>c</SUB>
and w<SUB>p</SUB> differ in the most significant bit and w<SUB>c</SUB>
&gt; w<SUB>p</SUB>, additionally the height of p and c is the same.
If p is the parent of c, then c is the child of p. Every node has
either a parent p or a child c; except in the case where the
HyPeerWeb has only one node.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Cap Node</B>:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A HyPeerWeb has zero or one cap node at
any given time. A node c is a cap node if c is a deletion point, w<SUB>c</SUB>
= 2<SUP>h</SUP> where w<SUB>c</SUB> is the web id of c, and the web
id of the fold of c is zero.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Insertion Point</B>:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The node i is the insertion point if
web id w<SUB>i</SUB> = w<SUB>p</SUB> + 1, where w<SUB>p</SUB> is the
deletion point parent's web id; the exception to this rule is if the
deletion point is a cap node, then i is node zero.</P>
